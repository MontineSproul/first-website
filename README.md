# Horiseon Website

## Description
Updated the HTML so that it is SEO compliant. This was done by adding alt attributes to all of the images and icons. 
Replaced all of the <div> elements with Semantic Elements. 
Linked the nav bar items to their corresponding sections. 
Title description the title is the name of the company/site rather than just using 'website'.
Refactored CSS to make it easier to read and see what is being done. Added comments to CSS explaining my changes.

Site is deployed on Github pages: https://github.com/MontineSproul/first-website/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages
